# The setup here requires the scripts live either in this repo or in the repo for reusable workflows and action in the same repo. 
# A. For scripts living in the repo for reusable workflows and actions: We can use github.action_path
# to run scripts from a running action, however, we cannot do this directly from a reusable workflow, we have
# to first call an action from  a reusable workflow and then call the script from that action.
# B: We can call scripts living in this repo by sending file paths to the reusable workflow or action
